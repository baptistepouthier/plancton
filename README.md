1. the SVM folder contains a SVM hierachical classifier using confusion matrix to sort synthetic data or plankton images. In the second case, we extract the SIFT features before running the classifier.

2. the CNN folder contain a CNN hierachical classifier using confusion matrix to sort plankton images.

ReportPlanktons present the CNN without the hierachy aspect (theory and results). PresentationPlanktons are the associated slides.
